                <blockquote><p class="quotation"><img src="7.jpg" alt="Bath"> Romantic relationships are the spice of life, they make us feel alive in a way that nothing else can.
                Genuine romance exists when two people show that they care for each other through small acts of love and affection.
                We feel loved and cared for when we know that our significant other is thinking about how to give us the most pleasure.
                Romance is the key to keeping the sparks flying. Without it, any relationship will soon lose its shine.</p>

              <p class="text_two">When I travel through airports, I notice folks who may seem invisible.
                For example, have you ever paid attention to the attendants who are stationed in airport bathrooms? In the men’s rooms (as I can only speak to this sector), some have a table and mouthwash. Their job is to keep the bathroom they’re assigned to, clean, sanitary, and nice for us to visit for only a few minutes. Can you imagine how nasty an airport bathroom could become in just one day, if these folks were not so strategically positioned?
                By mentioning this, I’m not trying in any way to diminish anyone’s value, station in life, or contribution to the greater good. Rather, I try to go out of my way to say hello, tell them “Thank you,” or contribute to their tip jars. Their response is often one of amazement that someone noticed they were there.
                Whenever I can, I try to erase the “in” from “invisible....”</p>

                A saying that has been familiar to every one of us during many points in our lives.
                
                Famous philosopher Aristotle explains it perfectly. In his lifelong journey to know the true meaning of life, he has managed to impart one of the most valuable pieces of wisdom.
                
                For him, there are two constants in life.
                
                One, that the universe is constantly changing. It is always evolving. What it is today is never the same tomorrow.
                
                And second, a thing he calls “entelechy.” It means, “that which turns potential into reality.”
                
                Aristotle believed that things happen today because they have a purpose later on.
                
                Every choice we make, every outcome that happens from these choices, every person who comes into our lives, and every person who leaves — all of these elements have a reason.
                
                They make us who we are today.</p>
